## 🐍 Project Description

This project focuses on **mastering Python decorators** to enhance and streamline database operations in Python applications. Through a series of hands-on tasks, developers will build custom decorators to:

- Log SQL queries  
- Handle and manage connections  
- Control transactions  
- Retry failed operations  
- Cache query results  

The tasks simulate real-world scenarios, offering a practical deep dive into Python's dynamic features for writing clean, reusable, and scalable code in database management.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, professional developers will be able to:

- ✅ Deepen their understanding of Python decorators to write clean, reusable, and efficient code.  
- ✅ Automate repetitive database operations such as connection handling, logging, and caching.  
- ✅ Implement robust transaction management for maintaining data integrity and handling exceptions gracefully.  
- ✅ Optimize performance by using caching mechanisms to avoid redundant database queries.  
- ✅ Add resilience to database logic by retrying operations in case of transient failures.  
- ✅ Apply best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and production-ready database code in Python.

## 🔑 Key Highlights

### 🧾 Task 0: Logging Database Queries
- Create a decorator to **log all SQL queries** executed by a function.  
- Learn how to **intercept and enhance** function calls for better observability.

---

### 🔄 Task 1: Handle Database Connections
- Build a decorator that **automatically handles database connections**.  
- Say goodbye to boilerplate code for opening and closing connections.

---

### 🔁 Task 2: Transaction Management Decorator
- Design a decorator to **manage commit/rollback logic** for transactions.  
- Ensure **robust error handling** and **data consistency** in all DB operations.

---

### 🛠️ Task 3: Retry Database Queries
- Create a decorator that **retries database operations** on failure.  
- Handle **transient issues gracefully** and build resilience into your queries.

---

### ⚡ Task 4: Cache Database Queries
- Build a decorator that **caches results** of database queries.  
- Significantly **improve performance** by avoiding repeated DB calls.
